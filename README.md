## Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning Algorithms for Emotion Recognition from text.

This model was developed in order to take any array of feedback or text in general and then generate what percentage of it had one of 5 emotions labelled against it.

The emotions are namely:
1. Anger
2. Fear
3. Joy
4. Neutral
5. Sadness

I have then created a spider chart to take these emotions and the percentages and then visualise the output.
